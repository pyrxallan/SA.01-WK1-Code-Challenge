## Description

This project features
#### ðŸ“Š Challenge 1: Student Grade Generator (Toy Problem)
- Functionality: Takes a student's mark (from 0 to 100) as input and outputs the corresponding grade.

- Grading Scale:

    A: > 79

    B: 60 - 79

    C: 49 - 59

    D: 40 - 49

    E: < 40

- Validation: Includes input validation to ensure the mark is within the 0-100 range.


#### ðŸš— Challenge 2: Speed Detector (Toy Problem)
- Functionality: Calculates demerit points for a car's speed based on a 70 km/h speed limit.

- Logic:

    - If the speed is below 70 km/h, it outputs "Ok".

    - For every 5 km/h over the speed limit, one demerit point is awarded.

    - If the total demerit points exceed 12, it outputs "License suspended".


#### ðŸ’°  Challenge 3: Net Salary Calculator (Toy Problem)
- Functionality: Calculates an individual's net salary based on basic salary and optional benefits.

- Calculations: Uses a detailed breakdown to calculate:

    - Gross Salary: Basic Salary + Benefits.

    - NSSF Deductions: Based on the latest 2025 Tier I and Tier II rates.

    - SHIF Deductions: A fixed percentage of the gross salary.

    - Housing Levy: A percentage of the gross salary, capped at a maximum amount.

    - PAYE (Tax): Calculated based on the 2025 progressive tax brackets after deductions and applying personal relief.

- Output: Presents a comprehensive breakdown of all deductions and the final net salary.
